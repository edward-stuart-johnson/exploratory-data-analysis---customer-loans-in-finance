# After converting your columns to a more appropriate format you may want to develop a class to extract information from the DataFrame and its columns. Create a DataFrameInfo class which will contain methods that generate useful information about your DataFrame.

# Some useful utility methods you might want to create that are often used for EDA tasks are:

#     Describe all columns in the DataFrame to check their data types
#     Extract statistical values: median, standard deviation and mean from the columns and the DataFrame
#     Count distinct values in categorical columns
#     Print out the shape of the DataFrame
#     Generate a count/percentage count of NULL values in each column
#     Any other methods you may find useful

# Creating a class like this will be useful in the future since these are common tasks for performing EDA on any dataset.
