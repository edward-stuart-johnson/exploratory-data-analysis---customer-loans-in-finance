# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

##the aim of the project

Managing loans is a critical component of business operations in a large financial institution.

To ensure informed decisions are made about loan approvals and risk is efficiently managed, the task is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data.

The task is to perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

This information will enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

By conducting exploratory data analysis on the loan data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans.

Ultimately, the goal is to improve the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio.
